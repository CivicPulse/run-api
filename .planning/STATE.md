## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- ZITADEL for auth (external OIDC provider at auth.civpulse.org)
- PostgreSQL RLS for multi-tenant data isolation (not application-level WHERE clauses)
- PostGIS for geographic operations (turf cutting, spatial voter queries)
- TaskIQ for async background jobs (voter import pipeline)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ZITADEL org-to-campaign mapping needs prototype validation during Phase 1
- fastapi-zitadel-auth library is relatively new; Authlib is the fallback
- PostGIS DBSCAN for political turf cutting has no reference implementation (Phase 3 risk)
