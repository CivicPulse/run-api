# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Any candidate, regardless of party or budget, can run professional-grade field operations from a single API.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Authentication and Multi-Tenancy

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Authentication and Multi-Tenancy)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Completed Plan 01-02 (campaign CRUD + ZITADEL)

Progress: [#░░░░░░░░░] 11%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 8 min
- Total execution time: 0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 15 min | 8 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (7 min), 01-02 (8 min)
- Trend: stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- ZITADEL for auth (external OIDC provider at auth.civpulse.org)
- PostgreSQL RLS for multi-tenant data isolation (not application-level WHERE clauses)
- PostGIS for geographic operations (turf cutting, spatial voter queries)
- TaskIQ for async background jobs (voter import pipeline)
- [01-01] Used StrEnum for campaign type/status enums per ruff modernization
- [01-01] JWKS cached indefinitely until decode failure triggers refresh
- [01-01] RLS policies use current_setting with true flag for NULL-safe missing config
- [01-01] B008 ruff rule suppressed globally (Depends() in defaults is standard FastAPI)
- [01-02] CampaignResponse.id uses uuid.UUID type for proper Pydantic serialization
- [01-02] Error handlers return ProblemResponse (not Problem) for ASGI compatibility
- [01-02] ensure_user_synced runs on every endpoint for belt-and-suspenders user/member sync
- [01-02] User created_at/updated_at set explicitly in ensure_user_synced (not relying on server_default)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ZITADEL org-to-campaign mapping needs prototype validation during Phase 1
- fastapi-zitadel-auth library is relatively new; Authlib selected (01-01 confirmed)
- PostGIS DBSCAN for political turf cutting has no reference implementation (Phase 3 risk)
